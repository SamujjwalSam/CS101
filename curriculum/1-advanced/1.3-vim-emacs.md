# Vim and Emacs

## What is Vim and Emacs?

Vim and Emacs are both editors that run directly in the terminal. They (normally) do not open up with a GUI, and are primarily controlled with the keyboard rather than the mouse (of course, all of these things can be changed/customized).

There is a long standing "war", between the users of the two editors about which is better. Kinda like the tabs vs. spaces war (of which the winner is, of course, tabs mapped to 4 spaces).

## Wait, but I already use Sublime/Atom/VS Code/Eclipse/a stone tablet and chisel?

GUI Editors are great for local machines, but if you are SSH'd into a machine (like the lab machines), it can be difficult or impossible to use a GUI application. Since Vim and Emacs operate entirely in the command line, they work over SSH (and just generally open and run faster than a big GUI application).
