# Helpful Tools and Programs

## Editors

Editors are useful for editing text files, and working on short or single code files.

Most of these editors are cross platform, and all of them are free

## GUI Editors

Text editors that use a traditional GUI.

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - Made by GitHub, so it integrates really well with Git
  - Nice themes, and customizable using CSS (and HTML/JS)
  - Lots of really nice plugins
  - Completely free
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - Also has lots of nice themes
  - Also has lots of plugins
  - Free, but you can also buy a key to actually register it

## Command Line Editors

Text editors that work in a terminal (and are therefore useful when SSHing). Both of these programs offer way more than text editing, but that's their main purpose. They both have whole hosts of plugins and configurations to customize them to your liking.

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environment. These programs are like text editors on steroids. They usually include specific debuggers, compilers, and other useful tools for specific languages like Java, C++, and more.

- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?FEATURED_STORY)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
- [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/)

## FTP/SSH Tools

FTP allows you to securely transfer files to and from a remote machine (e.g. the lab machines).

- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

SSH allows you to securely get shell access to a remote machine. You can natively SSH on MacOS and Linux. For Windows, you can use one of these methods:

- [PuTTY](https://putty.org/)
- [Using Windows 10's built in SSH tool](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/)
