# CS101 Proposal

## Purpose

For a lot of Computer Science freshmen, their first semester is the first time they will be exposed to things like Linux, SSHing, using Git or other version control systems, and more. For some students, this will be the first time that they are writing code in their lives. While classes like CS312 and CS314 do great jobs of introducing programming concepts, once students move into higher level classes, it's assumed that they know how to do things like SSH into the lab machines to test their code or use Git to submit their projects. Unfortunately, these skills are never explicitly taught to students; they are just expected to teach themselves or find someone else to show them how to do it. The aim of the CS101 series is to provide workshops and talks that would walk students through how to use these powerful tools, and give them a chance to learn and practice these skills with people around to help them. Offering these events would allow students to feel more comfortable in their CS classes and make their workflow more smooth and efficient.

## Topics

After having surveyed current UTCS students, I have compiled a list of topics that I think would be helpful to the greatest amount of students. These are also listed in a tentative order of events.

### Introductory topics

- Linux basics
  - How to navigate file directories, how to make files, how to edit files, a general tour of the UTCS lab machines
- SSH/FTP basics
  - How to set up SSH keys (now required if SSHing from off campus), how to SSH into a lab machine, how to transfer files to and from lab machines
- Helpful tools/programs
  - Introduce students to programs like editors (Atom, Sublime, `vim`, `emacs`), IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, BlueJ), FTP/SSH tools (WinSCP, FileZilla, PuTTY), terminal emulators (iTerm, WSL Ubuntu, etc.)

### Advanced topics

- Git/VCS basics
  - How to make repositories, how to add and commit files, how to push and pull from remote repo, how to set up a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket account, how to collaborate with classmates
- Linux advanced
  - How to use command line tools like `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `ln`, `tar`, `man`, `chmod`, `kill/killall`, `top`, etc.
- Debugging basics
  - How to use the Java/JS/C/C++ debugger, how to add breakpoints, how to view registers and memory
- Editors advanced
  - How to navigate and use `vim`/`emacs`, since they are very useful when SSH'ed into a lab machines

### Time-permitting topics

- Scripting
  - How to use bash, Python, cron, etc. to simplify tasks
- Customization
  - How to change shells, introduce things like `oh-my-zsh`, `vim`/`emacs` plugins,`.__shprofile`/`.__shrc`.


## Structure

### Timeline

This series would span the entire school year, with the 'introductory' topic events taking place during the fall semester and the 'advanced' topic events taking place during the spring semester. The 'time-permitting' topics could be added on at the end of the spring semester or put in between the other 'main' talks during the fall and spring semesters. The progression of the events would match with the things that students are learning in their classes with topics relevant to CS312/CS314 being covered in the fall and topics relevant to CS429/CS314 being covered in the spring.

### Event specifics

The events would be 1-1.5 hour long events. The presentations themselves should be short to allow for lots of time to field questions and help people one-on-one. There would also be a lot of examples and interactive steps to allow students to practice these new skills. The slides would also be posted before the event so that people could work through them at their own pace, as well as reference them after the event itself. We would draw our speakers from members and officers of ACM, as well as officers from other organizations that may have more expertise than ourselves.

### Officers

This series would mainly be a collaboration between the Academics and Web Officers, since these workshops are education-focused but also require some technical knowledge to make and teach.

## Other Notes

- Our current web workshops could be absorbed into this series in order to improve numbers for both types of events. Or, if we want to keep web workshops independent, we could advertise for CS101 during those events (and vice versa) since the two events are very similar.
